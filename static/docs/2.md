# Like Filthy Rags
*10/10/2024 by Phillip England*

When I was a Christian, I desperately wanted to please God with my behaviour. An impossible task.

I wanted to please God because I believed he had died a tortorous death on the cross for my sins. My personal infractions against God were washed clean by the blood of God himself.

Because of this, I worked very hard to be in a continual process of sanctification. Not because I believed this would save me, but because I believed a righteous life was evidence of my salvation.

I believe this because James wrote:

> "But someone will say, 'You have faith and I have works.'
> Show me your faith apart from your works,
> and I will show you my faith by my works."

> — James 2:18 ESV

In the next verse he states:

> "You believe that God is one; you do well.
> Even the demons believe—and shudder!"

> — James 2:19 ESV

## Well Done

I truly wanted to please God and I longed to hear him say, "well done, my good and faithful servant".

One night (after a few beers of course), my step-mother corrected me: "Phillip, you cannot please God, all of your actions are like *filthy rags* before God."

And, according to the Bible, she was right:

> "All of us have become like one who is unclean,
> and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags;
> we all shrivel up like a leaf,
> and like the wind our sins sweep us away."

> — Isaiah 64:6

Oh, how deeply this can impact your confidence and self-image.

## Christianity and Mental Health

In 2022, I was struggling with my mental health. I began to examine my life closely. Instead of engaging in my behavior, I became an observer of it.

I discovered something very challenging: Christianity had something to do with my mental health struggles.

At first, I avoided these thoughts (as most do). I pushed them aside and thought to myself, "I am the problem, not my faith."

Christianity put me in the position of feeling like I was the issue. Like something was deeply wrong with myself.

"My faith cannot possibly have a negative impact on my life", I thought.

## Matt Maeson - Sanctified

I went through a grueling divorce in 2019. I drove my ex-wife and daughter back to her hometown in Tennessee. After dropping her off, I found a church and threw myself on the ground in front of a cross. I had done such a thing many times before. This is where I always found myself in times of crisis.

Matt Maeson captures such a moment in his song, "[Sanctified](https://youtu.be/qvX-4ZWzeAA?si=9nat4yHoIut2MaC0)"

> "I came here to find a place in public
> Thought I'd dignify the truth that no one gets
> I am sanctified and fucking losing it
> I came here to cry, a babbling lunatic
> I got loosely based on places I had been
> To be lost and found and lost and found again
> I can't seem to find the truth in anything
> So I'll realign 'til I feel born again"

> — Sanctified by Matt Maeson

In his song, he clearly captures the cycle I am discussing. The cycle of sanctification. The process of realizing you can never please God with your behavior, and the internal war that takes place if you truly love God.

This war was the root of my mental health issues.

## My Issue With Christianity

Christianity has the potential to take normal, healthy people and turn them into haters of the self.

I hated myself because I was incapable of pleasing God. I was incapable of overcoming sin in my life.

At one point, I kept a log of every time I opened the incognito tab on my phone.

I would feel guilty for my sin, while at the same time knowing I would commit the exact same act in the near future.

Christianity has the potential to make people feel like they are doing a good thing on the surface, while deceptively eroding their identity into one of deep self-loathing beneath the surface.

In Christianity, humans are the problem. We are the problem. This is the teaching that has caused my life so much harm.

This is the teaching that I am attempting to undo in the lives of those around me.
