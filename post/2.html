A multitude of reasons rose to the surface. Divine knowledge, eternal security, love from an amazing creator. These things and more were all incentives to believe. Only when you stop believing do you realize how valuable these incentives truly are. Once I laid my beliefs down, the blanket of my faith withdrew, and I felt cold and naked.<p>As human beings, we have survival needs. Food, water, and shelter. But, we also have emotional needs. The need to be loved. The need to be noticed. The need to have purpose. These needs exist within us. The devil's advocate in me must ask: "Are these needs placed in us by God, to be fulfilled by God?"<p>Let's take our eyes off Christianity for a moment and turn our attention towards Islam. From the Christian perspective, we see clearly how Islam fulfills the emotional needs of Muslims. Does this encourage Muslims to continue in their belief? I am not claiming these emotional nets are put in place with vicious intent. Rather, these types of emotional nets are a fundamental aspect of belief systems as a whole. How do you have a belief system without incentive?<p>Does Christianity function similar to Islam in this regard?<h2 id=the-comfort-of-divine-knowledge>The Comfort Of Divine Knowledge</h2><p>Being clueless about how the world works is uncomfortable. We want to know, because knowing creates security. Knowing places us in a position of power. Christianity attempts to fill the gaps in our knowledge, and this provides a sense of comfort. It stokes our ego and makes us feel like we understand reality on a fundamental level.<p>Having answers to life's big questions help us sleep easy at night. Not having to worry about what will happen after death is cozy. Eradication of the unknown enables us to move forward in life with less friction. All of these benefits are part of the allure of Christianity, as well as other belief systems.<p>Saying, "I don't know" was very difficult for me. I wanted to be sure of my eternal destination. I wanted to be confident in the origins of life and the cosmos. I wanted to be able to tell my loved ones that I would see them after death. I still want these things. But to claim I know these things feels dishonest to me. It feels inauthentic. It feels like an active attempt to hide myself from my lack of knowledge.<h2 id=the-comfort-of-eternal-security>The Comfort Of Eternal Security</h2><p>To survive is to actively avoid death. All of us are engaging in this activity. But, the unavoidable day of our demise is creeping towards us at an unknown pace. This knowledge alone is enough to provoke an existential crisis. As humans, we all find ourselves grappling with this problem.<p>How does one attain eternal security? In Christianity, most people believe eternal security is attained via faith. Simply put, you must believe Jesus is the son of God who died and rose for your sins. Believe in Jesus; gain eternal security. The belief is the exchange. Failing to uphold your end of the bargain—belief—risks losing your eternal security. Any idea that lessens our death anxiety will be difficult to part from.<p>The eternal security one receives for their belief is a strong incentive to persist. Beliefs generate hope. They can give rise to a sense of peace in one's life. The fear of death may be eradicated. All of these things may blind someone to the faultiness of their faith. It may allow them to gloss over difficult aspects of the faith for fear of losing their eternal security.<h2 id=love-from-an-awesome-creator>Love From An Awesome Creator</h2><p>Who doesn't want to have the creator of the cosmos as their friend? It makes us feel special. We get to feel like the center of attention. We get to feel known by another on the deepest level possible. If things don't go our way, we get to feel like our best friend might patch things up. If God is your friend, what enemies can you have? These are all great things that tug at the emotional needs of the human condition. But can these emotional needs be exploited? I think they can.<p>If we take a moment to examine other faiths, we may find we believe their followers to be led astray. When they say, "I worship God", we may think, "Not the true God." If we can think others wrong in their faith, can we think ourselves wrong in our own? Of course not! We can't be wrong—our faith insists we are right. How much influence does our desire to be loved have on this dynamic? Does our deep need for love blind us to our ability to examine ourselves in the same way we critique believers of other faiths?<p>I want to be known and loved by God. I want to be seen by somebody. I want to feel like my steps are guided by a Father who adores me. And I want these things so badly that I've turned a blind eye to the jagged aspect of my faith. I'm willing to put up with an entire congregation speaking in tongues, in exchange for God's love. I'm willing to ignore the lack of miracles, in exchange for feeling noticed.<p>Jesus himself says:</p><bible-quote title="John 4:12" translation=NIV>Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.</bible-quote><p>When I don't see the miracles, I cling tighter to my faith.</tw-markdown></article></main></div><aside><title-links target=#article offset=-140 link-wrapper-class=flex link-class="p-4 w-full hover:underline border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800" class="fixed scrollbar-hidden overflow-y-scroll top-0 z-40 right-0 hidden xl:flex text-sm p-4 flex-col text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 h-full dark:bg-black bg-white hidden xl:w-[20%] xl:max-w-[300px]"></title-links></aside><script src=https://phillip-england.github.io/www.philthy.blog/static/js/index.js></script>
