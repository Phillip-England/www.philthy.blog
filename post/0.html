I know I believe in you, but I also want to be open and honest about how I feel about other aspects of my Christian upbringing. Maybe writing to you will help to bring me some clarity.<p>I am not sure <em>which</em> God you are, but I do believe you are God. When I read the stories of the Old Testament, I read of a harsh war God set against his enemies. When I read stories of Jesus, I see in you love and compassion.<p>I find it very difficult to square these two ideas. I have a hard time submitting to a figure who calls for constant bloodshed. Who requires blood to grant forgiveness. These ideas seem to me to be that of ancient men concerned with war and conquest. I do not hear these ideas and think, "now that sounds like the creator of the cosmos who loves and cares for us."<p>But who am I to make such a call?<h2 id=i-want-to-be-honest>I Want To Be Honest</h2><p>I am dedicated to these ideas and the pursuit of knowing who you are. In the past, I felt the need to keep my doubts to myself for fear of leading others astray. That is, I felt something was fundamentally wrong with me for think the Bible might have flaws. Now, I feel it is wrong to pretend that I accept a book at face value, especially when I have not even read it all.<p>I am dedicated to reading the Bible in it's entirety and being completely open and honest about how the words on the page make me feel. I am not entering this expedition with an intent on proving the Bible true or false. I am simply going to engage with it like I would any other text. I aim to dig deep. To understand the historical context. To learn all the things that were left out of my typically Sunday morning Christian experience.<p>I want to know and be known by you. And if I can find you in that book, I will search fervently.<h2 id=my-behavior-and-escaping-sin>My Behavior and Escaping Sin</h2><p>Sometimes, people can get the impression that one has abandoned the faith in favor of some sin habit. Lord, you know my heart and intentions. You know I am just as much a sinner today as I was yesterday when I called myself, "Christian."<p>Lord, I commit to you that I will do my best to be a loving Father to my daughter. That when I work with my hands I will do it in your honor. That when I change the course of my ship, I do so because I believe you have asked me to change directions.<p>These aspects of my Christian faith have not changed, and I find great value in this dynamic.<h2 id=my-mental-health>My Mental Health</h2><p>I found myself in dark place, constantly begging you for forgiveness. My proximity to you made me feel so small in comparison. The way you turned Lot's wife to salt for looking back made me ask, <em>"Would God do the same to me?"</em><p>I thought my fear of you was a good and honorable thing, as taught in Proverbs 9:10 (NIV):</p><bible-quote title="Proverbs 9:10" translation=NIV>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</bible-quote><p>And when others pointed out 1 Peter 5:7 (NIV), I thought myself alone in my great fear of God:</p><bible-quote title="1 Peter 5:7" translation=NIV>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</bible-quote><p>These ideas weight on me. The process of sanctification left my exhausted. Then, to make matters worse, I would read verses like Revelation 3:16:</p><bible-quote title="Revelation 3:16" translation=NIV>So I will spit you out of my mouth, because you are only warm and not hot or cold.</bible-quote><p>Are you going to chew me up and spit me out?<h2 id=moving-forward>Moving Forward</h2><p>I aim to continue my relationship with God, but it will not look the same as it has in the past. In the past, I took the Bible as the literal truth about reality. That the words on those pages mapped perfectly onto the world we currently find ourselves in. I no longer believe this to be the case. And what a great void this has left within me.<p>Going from knowing everything to knowing nothing is a jarring experience.<p>I aim to dedicate myself to you God. To knowing you. To seeking you out in all the nooks and crannies of my life. To honoring you with my behavior in the best way that I can.<p>And I will do this despite my fears. I am terrified to embark on this journey, but to turn back now would to submit to my cowardice. I am tired of being a coward.</tw-markdown></article></main></div><aside><title-links target=#article offset=-140 link-wrapper-class=flex link-class="p-4 w-full hover:underline border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800" class="fixed scrollbar-hidden overflow-y-scroll top-0 z-50 right-0 hidden xl:flex text-sm p-4 flex-col text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 h-full dark:bg-black bg-white hidden xl:w-[20%] xl:max-w-[300px]"></title-links></aside><script src=https://phillip-england.github.io/www.philthy.blog/static/js/index.js></script>
