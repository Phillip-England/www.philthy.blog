<h1 class="font-bold text-3xl pt-4 pb-1">Why am I Writing?</h1>
<p class="text-xs italic pb-8"><em>10/3/2024 by Phillip England</em></p>
<p class="mb-4">Hello, my name is Phillip England, and I am no longer a Christian. The process of my deconversion has been one of the most challenging things I&#39;ve ever walked through. I went from being certain about everything, to feeling like I know nothing. My sense of self has been shattered, and I am still actively picking up the pieces of my life.</p>
<p class="mb-4">It is difficult for me to put these words in front of you. As I write, I still wonder, &#34;Will I burn in hell for this?&#34; But my why is bigger than my fear.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I am doing this for three reasons:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-4 flex flex-col gap-4 pb-8 pt-4">
<li>To be a friend to those who are actively deconverting.</li>
<li>To help Christians understand how their faith can be harmful to themselves and those around them.</li>
<li>To provide an insider&#39;s perspective to non-Christians so they can better understand the faith.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mb-4">The deconversion process can feel very isolating. I want to create a place where people can know they are not alone in their struggle. I am very grateful for those who&#39;ve helped me in my process, and I want to give back to the community in any way I can.</p>
<p class="mb-4">This is why I am writing. My motivation is to help. I understand people will think I am dragging others to hell with my words. They can continue to think so. I will continue to share despite the looming threats of hell.</p>
<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl pt-8 pb-8">Who Am I?</h2>
<p class="mb-4">I am a 31-year-old male from Tulsa, Oklahoma. I work at a Chick-fil-A restaurant, and I&#39;ve lived in the Bible Belt for my entire life. I live within walking distance of Oral Roberts University, a Christian college people travel from all around the world to attend. I am completely surrounded by the Christian faith on all sides and can provide an insider&#39;s look at how Christianity practically plays out in the lives of believers.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Despite growing up in a Christian household, my faith did not take flight until around 2014. At the time, I was struggling with a life-threatening drug addiction. I stepped out of my drug addiction and into the arms of Christianity. I made being a &#34;Good Christian&#34; my number one aim in life and continued to live this way for the next decade.</p>
<p class="mb-4">People who know me will attest to this: the Christian faith changed my life for the better. Just a few weeks ago, I was looking over some old photos of me from around 2015 with a coworker. The drastic change in my character and appearance has served as a testimony to those around me. Sometimes, the fear of hell and the desire to please God can result in a truly life-changing experience for people. Christianity is not all bad. It has great capacity to do good in the lives of those who believe. But this is not the whole story. There is more to faith than positive life change.</p>
<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl pt-8 pb-8">To Those Who Know Me</h2>
<p class="mb-4">I understand these words are hard to read. I know you fear for my soul. What else could I expect? If you truly care for someone, and you truly think them to be in harm&#39;s way, you should speak up and say something.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Remember, in the same way you think my perspective is harmful, I believe the same about Christianity. I am speaking up because I feel the Christian faith can bring great harm to those who believe.</p>
<p class="mb-4">In this way, we can relate. We are both doing what we feel is right. Our motivations are our common ground.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Your prayers are welcomed. If I am wrong, I would like to know. If the Christian faith is true, I would like to be educated by God. I am not resistant to believing in Christianity. In fact, I <em>want</em> to believe in Christianity. I just simply don&#39;t.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The path I am taking is not an easy decision. This is difficult for me. I&#39;ve spent a year contemplating the direction I will take in my life. I&#39;ve found time and time again the true source of my faith is fear. I am afraid to leave the faith. I am afraid to say something. I am afraid of being punished. And it takes great bravery to face these fears.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I love you all.</p>
